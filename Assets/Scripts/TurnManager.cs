	//Provides a place where player/unit/grid managers can go to see if they should perform certain actions.
	//Should have a public player for who the current player is. If the current player is the ai, then 
	//the user's actions are mostly disabled. They should still be able to touch/hover over units, though.
	//When it's the AI's turn, it should also let the AIManager know that it can do it's thing.
	//At the start of a turn, it should run the NewTurn method on the player whose turn it is.
	//It should record a record of each turn and the actions performed in it. Maybe it has a list of Actions
	//for each turn.
